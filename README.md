# TuneCube

TuneCube is dedicated software for DJs, dance event organizers, and party attendees. It continuously listens to the music playing on the dance floor and provides information about the current and previous song titles (like Shazaam). Detected titles are added to a dedicated Spotify playlist, accessible by scanning a QR code displayed on the screen.

## Purpose

The goal of TuneCube is to make life easier for DJs, organizers, and event attendees. 
- **For DJs**: You can easily share a link to your playlist with anyone interested.
- **For Organizers**: If multiple DJs are performing at an event, you can provide a complete playlist of the entire event.
- **For Attendees**: You can access the whole event playlist or simply focus on dancing, knowing that youâ€™ll find the name of that one special song later on the display screen.

## How it works?

## Main Features

- **Song Recognition**: Utilizes Shazam to recognize songs being played.
- **Spotify Integration**: Adds recognized songs to a dedicated Spotify playlist.
- **Playlist Sharing**: Share the playlist using a QR code displayed on an external screen.

## Technologies Used

- **Docker**: Containerized infrastructure for easy deployment.
- **Backend**: Python 3.11, [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), [Shazamio](https://github.com/shazamio/ShazamIO), and [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io) for song recognition.
- **Frontend**: Node.js and React.
- **GUI Environment**: Ubuntu, XOrg, and Chromium.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- A board like Raspberry Pi with a clean installation of Ubuntu Server.
- **Software Requirements**: Xorg, PulseAudio, and NetworkManager.
- **External Components**:
  - Sound card with microphone input and dedicated microphone.
  - External display for show the user interface and QR code.

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Configure the `.env` file with your Spotify API keys (create a new Spotify app on [Spotify Developr Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)) and path to the PulseAudio socket on your host machine. 
4. Build and start the project using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   $ docker-compose --profile default build
   ```
   ```bash
   $ docker-compose --profile develop up -d
   ```

5. In browser open `http://tune_backend:5000/login` and log-in to Spotify
6. Shutdown developer mode by:
   ```bash
   $ docker-compose --profile develop down
   ```

7. Run standard mode by:
   ```bash
   $ docker-compose --profile default up -d
   ```

8. Ensure that your external sound card and display are properly connected and configured.

### Hardware Prototype (Example Setup)

First prototype was built from almost parts I had at home:

- Display: Aputure V-Screen VS-2 FineHD (~600 PLN)
- Board: Raspberry Pi 4 8GB (~350 PLN)
- Microphone: BOYA BY-MM1 (~100 PLN)
- Sound Card USB with Mic Input: Unitek Y-247A (~50 PLN)
- Wireless USB Adapter: Lanberg NC-1200-WI (~50 PLN)
- DC-DC Converter 12V - 5V USB-C (~30zl)
- 12V Power Supply: POS-50-12-C2 12V/4,2A/50,4W  (~50 PLN)

(I only bought a new power supply...)

For those interested, I am providing the [Autodesk Fusion 3D file with the 3D model for the enclosure used in the prototype](https://radoslaw.gierwialo.com/tunecube/body.f3z). Feel free to download and modify it as needed for your own projects.

Contributions are welcome! If you would like to contribute, feel free to fork the repository, create a feature branch, and submit a pull request. Whether itâ€™s fixing a bug, adding new features, or improving the documentation, your help is greatly appreciated. Letâ€™s make TuneCube even better together!


TuneCube has been divided into modules to make future development and expansion as straightforward as possible. With this structure in place, I hope you wonâ€™t have any excuses for not pitching in! ðŸ˜‰

## Future Updates & Todos

TuneCube is in a very early stage, currently at the proof-of-concept phase. Planned improvements include:

- Enhanced UI scaling for small screens
- Simplification of the `docker-compose.yaml` file, potentially by splitting it into two separate files instead of using `--profiles`
- Storing all data inside single SQLite database
- Simpify process for obtaining the Auth Token and Refresh Token from Spotify
